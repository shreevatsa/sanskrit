Notes on the diff files for Bhartṛhari:
  48.9 (4) means Kosambi 1948, verse 9, page 4 (and 4+105=109, so 00000109.tif).

Comparision with Heidelberg:
- <s>Fewer metres (#3)</s>
- No information about metres (#5)
+ Can handle "ity api", "tvayy eva" and similar.
+ Recognizes metre even if only one line is correct.
+ Calls out viṣama-pādānta-laghu, doesn't just promote laghus to gurus when needed.

Things discovered:
- GRETIL texts are full of typos.
  Positive view: we can use metrical analysis to detect many of them.

- Viṣama-pādānta-laghu is more common in which metres, compared to which.
- Even Kalidasa has one bug.

  [Some insights on grouping metres into families]
  [But her force-fitting metres to patterns seems unnatural and
   stretched in many places.]

    Deo defines her "Indravajrā family" by the regex (p. 23):
    '(G|LL?)(GL?)(G|LL)(GL?|LL)(L?)(G|LL?)(GL)(G|LL)(GL?)'
    [That matches 3*2*2*3*2*3*1*2*2 = 864 patterns.]
    She bases this family on iambic tetrameter + constraints.
    She also defines a bunch of "trochaic tetrameter" metres (p. 8):
    '(G|LL)' * 8
    [That matches 2^8 = 256 patterns.]
    Check whether we find more matching metres in these families.

    Questionable:
    "the basic assumption in generative metrics that periodic rhythm underlies
    all metrical verse."

    1300+ metres and Deo's haṃsī (GGGGLLLLLG) is still not in our list.
    Neither is *her* Mañjubhāṣiṇī, which is LGLGGLLLGLGLG.
    Go through the metres mentioned in her paper.

    "The traditionally documented description of Haṃsī specifies that
     the meter is characterized by a caesura only after the fourth
     syllable. bhramaravilasitā, the minimal pair for Haṃsī, lacks
     such a caesura."
     --> but in Vrttaratnakara list, it does have such a caesura?
